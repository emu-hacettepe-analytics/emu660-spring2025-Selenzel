    "text": "The Pandemic has had profound effects on the society and economy worldwide. It can be said that with the pandemic our lives had changed significantly and maybe some can not even remember what the life was like before pandemic. This had positive and negative impacts on the countries. This project investigates such impacts with the scope of Türkiye. The Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) databases will be used during this analysis of the Türkiye’s situation regarding to the impact of Covid-19 on Türkiye. The main objective is to understand the reasons and structural changes that might have happens after the Covid-19 by comparing the pre and post pandemic periods.\nThis project will mainly focuses on the population growth, birth and death rates, martial behaviors employment situations, trading activities. The focus will be on 3 periods 2018-2019 the pre-pandemic period, 2020 - 2022 pandemic period and lastly 2023-2024 post-pandemic period. Even though there is multiple years data on the TUIK’s database i narrowed the years to these fundamental 7 years to avoid any seasonality of the previous years recession."

Also the data sets weer small in comparison to other topic i could have analyzed. What i did basically is tidying data via the tidy methodologies of the Hadley Wickham (1). I formatted my data into his ideology of data shaping this way it was much easier to use the data sets i obtained from TUIK."
